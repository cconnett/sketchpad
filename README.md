# Sketchpad
A constraint-based geometry sketching tool.

Sketchpad allows drawing by specifying nothing but **constraints**. _"These two segments are perpendicular; this segment is tangent to this arc,"_ and so on. Sketchpad uses the powerful [Z3 Theorem Prover](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) to solve the analytic geometry problem presented by the constraints you specify. The output drawing is an exact algebraic solution to your set of constraints. Don't like where some element ended up? It's because your sketch was underspecified :D 

Sketchpad can find every degree-of-freedom in your sketch---even ones solvers using Newton's method would miss!
